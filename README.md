As, this is my first attempt towards learning frontend application development, I started learning React which a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Developing this application helped me understand creating components in React, maintaining the state in each component, passing the state from parent to child, passing props and calling webhook methods. This application contains a basic UI of product catalog page which has the ability to add items to cart, remove items from the cart, reset the items in cart and show the total items in the cart in navigation bar.
